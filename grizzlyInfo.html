            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) stands as an iconic symbol of the untamed wilderness, 
              embodying both strength and resilience. 
              This formidable species, 
              found in North America,
              has captured the fascination of wildlife enthusiasts and researchers alike. 
              In this essay, we will explore five key aspects of the grizzly bear: its habitat, physical characteristics, behavior, ecological role, and conservation status.

            <h1>environmental habitat</h1>
            <p>
              Grizzly bears inhabit a diverse range of ecosystems, 
              from dense forests to open meadows,
              and from Arctic tundra to alpine regions.
              They are primarily found in North America, 
              with significant populations in Alaska, Canada, and the northwestern United States. 
              Their adaptability to various habitats reflects the grizzly bear's ability to thrive in environments that demand both strength and resourcefulness.

          <h1>Physical Characteristics</h1>
          <p>
            The grizzly bear is characterized by its massive build, 
            humped shoulders, and distinctive silver-tipped fur that gives it a grizzled appearance.
            Adult males can weigh up to 1,500 pounds, standing on powerful limbs and large paws equipped with sharp claws. 
            Their keen sense of smell, excellent hearing, and decent eyesight contribute to their prowess as apex predators. 
            These physical attributes make the grizzly bear a formidable force in its natural environment.

        <div id="4" class="behavior">
          <h1>natural behavior</h1>
          <p>
            Grizzly bears are generally solitary animals, 
            except during the mating season or when a mother is caring for her cubs. 
            They are omnivorous, with a diet that includes berries, roots, insects, and small mammals.
            Known for their fishing prowess, grizzlies are often observed catching salmon during the annual salmon runs in rivers and streams.
            Despite their imposing size, grizzly bears are also known for their agility and can run at surprising speeds when needed.
          </p>

        <div id="5" class="role">
          <h1>Ecological Role</h1>
          <p>
            As apex predators,
            grizzly bears play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance. 
            By controlling herbivore populations and influencing vegetation growth, 
            they contribute to the health and diversity of their habitats. 
            Additionally, their feeding habits, 
            such as the dispersal of salmon carcasses in river ecosystems,
            provide nutrients that benefit a variety of other wildlife species.
            The grizzly bear, therefore, serves as a keystone species, influencing the structure and function of the ecosystems it inhabits.
