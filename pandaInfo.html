            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a charismatic and iconic species native to the mountainous regions of central China. 
                Renowned for its distinctive black-and-white fur and endearing appearance,
                 the giant panda has become a symbol of global wildlife conservation efforts.

            <h1>environmental habitat</h1>
            <p>
                Giant pandas primarily inhabit bamboo forests in the mountainous regions of southwestern China, at elevations ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet (1,500 to 3,000 meters). These forests provide the pandas with the bamboo they rely on for sustenance, as well as the dense vegetation and steep terrain that offer them shelter and seclusion.

          <h1>Physical Characteristics</h1>
          <p>
            Giant pandas are easily recognizable by their unique black-and-white fur pattern. Their bodies are predominantly white, with black fur patches around their eyes, ears, shoulders, and legs. The round face features black patches over the eyes and ears, creating an endearing appearance. Adult pandas typically weigh between 200 and 300 pounds (90 to 135 kilograms) and measure about 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 meters) in length.

          <h1>natural behavior</h1>
          <p>
            Diet: The giant panda's diet consists almost entirely of bamboo, supplemented occasionally with other plant-based foods, small mammals, or birds. They have specialized adaptations, such as an enlarged wrist bone that functions like a thumb, helping them grasp and manipulate bamboo stems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solitary Nature: Giant pandas are generally solitary animals, with adults coming together primarily during the breeding season. They mark their territories with scent markings, vocalizations, and clawing trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nocturnal Habits: Giant pandas are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. They spend a significant portion of their day resting and sleeping in trees or on the ground.

        <div id="5" class="role">
          <h1>Ecological Role</h1>
          <p>
            Giant pandas play a crucial role in maintaining the biodiversity of their habitats. As bamboo eaters, they influence the structure and composition of the forests they inhabit. By dispersing seeds through their droppings, they contribute to the regeneration of bamboo stands and other vegetation. This role helps maintain the health of the ecosystem and benefits other species sharing their habitat.
