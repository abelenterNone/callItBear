            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large carnivorous mammal native to the Arctic region. It is well-adapted to its icy habitat and is the largest land carnivore. Polar bears are highly dependent on sea ice for hunting and are considered marine mammals due to their reliance on the marine environment for sustenance.

            <h1>environmental habitat</h1>
            <p>
              Polar bears primarily inhabit the Arctic Circle, including areas such as the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas, and surrounding landmasses. They are often found on sea ice, which they use as a platform for hunting seals, their primary prey. During the warmer months, when sea ice melts, polar bears may come ashore and spend time on land.

        <div id="3" class="characteristic">
          <h1>Physical Characteristics</h1>
          <p>
            Polar bears have several adaptations that make them well-suited to their frigid environment. Their fur appears white, providing excellent camouflage in the snow, although their skin is actually black. This dark color helps absorb and retain heat from the sun. They possess large, powerful limbs and paws, which aid in swimming and walking on ice. Polar bears are strong swimmers and can cover long distances in search of food. Their keen sense of smell is crucial for detecting seals from great distances.

        <div id="4" class="behavior">
          <h1>natural behavior</h1>
          <p>
            Polar bears are primarily solitary animals, with males being more territorial than females. Their behavior is closely tied to the availability of sea ice and the distribution of seals. Polar bears are expert hunters and rely on sea ice as a platform to hunt seals, their primary prey. They use a patient stalking approach near breathing holes or seal lairs and can swim long distances to find food.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            During the ice-free summer months, polar bears may come ashore and enter a state of fasting, living off stored fat until the sea ice returns. They may scavenge on carcasses, forage for vegetation, or hunt other terrestrial animals if necessary.
          </p>

        <div id="5" class="role">
          <h1>Ecological Role</h1>
          <p>
            Polar bears play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of the Arctic marine environment. As apex predators, they help regulate seal populations, which in turn influences the entire food web. The health of the polar bear population is indicative of the overall health of the Arctic ecosystem.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The relationship between polar bears, sea ice, and seals is delicate and highly impacted by climate change. The reduction of sea ice due to global warming poses a significant threat to polar bears, as it limits their access to prey and forces them to travel longer distances to find food. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensuring the survival of these iconic Arctic predators and preserving the delicate balance of the polar ecosystem.
