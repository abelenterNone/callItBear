            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) is the smallest bear species and is known for its distinctive crescent-shaped chest marking, often referred to as the "sun" on its chest. Found in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia, the sun bear is recognized for its arboreal lifestyle, unique physical characteristics, and a diet that includes a variety of fruits, insects, and honey.

        <div id="2" class="Habitat">
          <li>
            <h1>environmental habitat</h1>
            <p>
                Sun bears inhabit the dense tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, and parts of Cambodia and Laos. They are adaptable to various forest types, ranging from lowland rainforests to montane forests. Sun bears are often associated with primary and secondary forests, but they can also be found in swampy areas.

        <div id="3" class="characteristic">
          <h1>Physical Characteristics</h1>
          <p>
            Sun bears are characterized by their sleek, short black fur, and the distinctive golden or orange crescent-shaped patch on their chest, resembling a rising or setting sun. They have a stocky build with strong, curved claws and a long tongue, well-adapted for extracting insects and honey from tree bark. Their relatively small size, compared to other bear species, makes them well-suited for an arboreal lifestyle. Adult sun bears typically weigh between 27 to 80 kilograms (60 to 176 pounds).

        <div id="4" class="behavior">
          <h1>natural behavior</h1>
          <p>
            Sun bears are primarily solitary, and their behavior is influenced by their tropical forest habitat. They are excellent climbers and spend a significant amount of time in trees, where they forage for fruits, insects, and honey. Their strong claws and powerful jaws make them adept at breaking into tree bark to access insect larvae and honey.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            These bears are known for their remarkable tree-climbing skills, allowing them to navigate the forest canopy efficiently. Sun bears are also excellent swimmers and may use water bodies for foraging or escaping predators.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div id="5" class="role">
          <h1>Ecological Role</h1>
          <p>
            As omnivores, sun bears play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of their habitats. Their diet includes a variety of fruits, nuts, insects, small vertebrates, and honey. They contribute to seed dispersal and help control insect populations, thereby influencing the composition and structure of their tropical forest ecosystems.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of sun bears, as they face significant threats such as habitat loss due to deforestation, illegal hunting, and the pet trade. Initiatives focus on protecting their natural habitats, combating poaching, and raising awareness about the importance of conserving this unique and vulnerable bear species.
