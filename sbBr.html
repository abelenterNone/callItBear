            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) is the only bear species native to South America and is also known as the Andean bear. Recognized for the distinctive light-colored facial markings that give the appearance of "spectacles" around their eyes, these bears are found in the Andean mountain range, spanning Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and northwestern Argentina. The spectacled bear is the largest land carnivore in South America.

            <h1>environmental habitat</h1>
            <p>
                Spectacled bears are adapted to a variety of ecosystems within the Andean region, ranging from cloud forests to high-altitude grasslands. They are particularly associated with montane and p√°ramo habitats, where they find ample vegetation, including their preferred food source, bromeliads. These bears are capable of navigating both steep, rocky terrains and dense forests.

          <h1>Physical Characteristics</h1>
          <p>
            Spectacled bears exhibit significant sexual dimorphism, with males being larger than females. They have a distinctive appearance, with short, black fur and a beige to brownish patch around their eyes, giving the impression of eyeglasses or spectacles. The size of the facial markings varies between individuals. Their relatively short face and snout distinguish them from other bear species. Adult spectacled bears typically weigh between 100 to 200 kilograms (220 to 440 pounds).
          </p>

        <div id="4" class="behavior">
          <h1>natural behavior</h1>
          <p>
            Spectacled bears are generally solitary animals, and their behavior can be influenced by the availability of food. They are adept climbers and spend a considerable amount of time in trees, both foraging and resting. Their diet is omnivorous, consisting of a variety of plant materials, such as fruits, berries, and leaves, as well as insects and small mammals. Bromeliads, which they obtain by breaking branches or using their claws, are a particular favorite.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Female spectacled bears give birth to one or two cubs, and the family unit remains together for an extended period before the young bears become independent.
          </p>

        <div id="5" class="role">
          <h1>Ecological Role</h1>
          <p>
            As an apex predator, the spectacled bear plays a crucial role in shaping its ecosystem. By controlling herbivore populations and influencing plant growth through their foraging habits, these bears contribute to the overall balance of the Andean ecosystems. Additionally, they are important seed dispersers, helping maintain plant diversity in their habitats.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Despite their ecological importance, spectacled bears face threats such as habitat loss, fragmentation, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts focus on preserving their habitats, mitigating conflicts with local communities, and raising awareness about the importance of protecting this unique bear species.
